  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

IBC is an acronym for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, which is a protocol for secure message passing between heterogeneous blockchains. It is a central piece of the Cosmos vision, as it will enable blockchains to interract in ways that were not possible before. For a deeper look at IBC, please refer to the [IBC documentation](https://ibcprotocol.org/documentation).
