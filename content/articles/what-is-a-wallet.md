  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

A crypto wallet is like a debit card. Debit cards do not store funds but instead, they give people access to their funds wherever they choose to spend them. Wallets in the blockchain universe similarly do not store funds but instead provide people with access to their tokens and the ability to make transactions with them.
