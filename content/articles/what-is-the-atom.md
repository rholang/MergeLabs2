  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

The ATOM is the Cosmos Hub’s primary token and secures the Hub’s valuable interchain services. If you hold ATOM, you can temporarily lock them up to contribute to the security of the Cosmos Hub using a mechanism called [Staking](/learn/faq/what-is-staking). In exchange for locking your ATOM, you receive [rewards](/learn/faq/what-rewards-can-be-expected-when-staking-atoms) in newly minted ATOM and a share of the transaction fees that are collected by the blockchain. However, staking [is not risk free](/learn/faq/what-are-the-risks-associated-with-staking). 

By staking ATOM, you are able to vote in Cosmos Hub governance decisions.
