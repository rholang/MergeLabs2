  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Blockchains that use staking, such as the Cosmos Hub, are primarily operated by a set of actors called [validators](/learn/faq/what-is-a-validator). The status of a validator (active or candidate), as well as its weight, is established based on its amount of voting power. Voting power is obtained when ATOM are locked in the staking process and must be granted to a validator or validator candidate. This process is called delegating. 

In practice, delegating is automatic when ATOM holders start staking. A single staking transaction starts the process of locking up ATOM and delegating to one or more validators. Transactions are performed using a [Wallet](/learn/faq/what-is-a-wallet). The transaction requires you to specify the amount of ATOM to stake and the validator or validators you want to delegate to. The Wallet takes care of the rest by generating and sending the transaction.

Validators never obtain custody of the ATOM delegated to them. There is no risk for validators to "steal" their delegators ATOM. However, there is a risk for delegated ATOM to be slashed if the validator they are delegated to misbehaves. See [What are the risks associated with Staking](/learn/faq/what-are-the-risks-associated-with-staking).
